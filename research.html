	<span class="whole_website">The science of reading research has been around for decades but it hasn't come to the forefront of education until much more recently. Elementary educators are now required to take an in depth professional development program, LETRS, to learn the best ways to teach children how to read. Reading ability directly relates to high school success. It is important for educators to be well versed in this research to close reading gaps and help students succeed in their literacy knowledge development. <br><br>
